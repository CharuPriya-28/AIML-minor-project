# AIML Minor Project – Housing Price Prediction 🏡

## 📌 Overview
Analyzed housing data using Python and Machine Learning to understand pricing trends.

## ⚙️ Steps
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- Price range analysis
- AC vs Non-AC price comparison
- Parking impact
- Area & prefarea price gap

 ## ⚙️ TO DO
 
- Major Project – Data exploration and visualization from housing.csv

1. How many houses are in the range of prices from 0-25lakhs, 26-50lakhs, 51-75lakhs, 76-100lakhs and >100lakhs. Visualize it using a line chart also

2. Find average house prices for houses having AC and nonAC. Plot the relationship using a barchart.

3. Simulate the relationship between parking and house price.

4. What is price gap between the houses having <5000sqft & no prefarea , and >5000sqft & there is prefarea?
